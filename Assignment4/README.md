# CS 3305 - Assignment 4: Process Scheduling Simulation

## Description
This program, created by Andrei Merkulov for the CS 3305 course, simulates the execution of processes using three different scheduling algorithms: First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR). It aims to demonstrate the efficiency and characteristics of each algorithm by calculating and displaying wait times, turnaround times, and averages for a set of processes read from an input file.

## Features
- Simulates process scheduling using FCFS, SJF, and RR algorithms.
- Reads process information from a file (assuming a specific format for process data).
- Calculates and displays wait times and turnaround times for each process.
- Computes and displays the average wait and turnaround times for all processes.
